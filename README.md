# 🎯 YOUR FIRST AI-POWERED PROJECT

Welcome to your practice workspace! This folder is pre-configured and ready for you to start coding with AI.

## 📂 What's In This Folder?

- **main.py** - Your main code file (currently empty, ready for your AI-generated code)
- **requirements.txt** - List of Python libraries this project needs
- **venv/** - Your virtual environment (created by setup script)
- **README.md** - This file!

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Open This Folder in Your Editor

1. Open **Cursor** or **VS Code**
2. Click `File → Open Folder`
3. Select this folder (`02_My_First_Project`)

### Step 2: Open the Terminal

**Windows:** Press `Ctrl + `` (backtick)
**Mac:** Press `Cmd + `` (backtick)

You'll see a terminal panel open at the bottom of your editor.

### Step 3: Activate Your Virtual Environment

In the terminal, type:

**Windows:**
```
venv\Scripts\activate
```

**Mac/Linux:**
```
source venv/bin/activate
```

**Success indicator:** You should see `(venv)` appear at the start of your terminal line:
```
(venv) C:\...\02_My_First_Project>
```

### Step 4: Start Coding with AI!

Now you're ready to use AI. Here's your first project:

#### 🎬 Project: YouTube Video Downloader

**Open Cursor's AI Chat** (Press `Ctrl+L` or `Cmd+L`)

**Paste this prompt:**

```
Create a Python script in main.py that downloads YouTube videos.

Requirements:
- Ask user for YouTube URL
- Download in best quality
- Save to a "downloads" folder
- Show download progress
- Add detailed comments explaining the code

Make it beginner-friendly.
```

**What happens:**
- AI generates the complete code
- Click "Apply" or copy the code
- Paste it into `main.py`
- Save the file (`Ctrl+S` / `Cmd+S`)

**Run your program:**
```
python main.py
```

**🎉 You just built your first application with AI!**

## 🛠️ What If Something Goes Wrong?

### Error: "No module named 'yt_dlp'"

**Solution:**
```
pip install yt-dlp
```

### Error: "python is not recognized"

**Solution:**
1. Make sure Python is installed: https://python.org/downloads
2. During installation, check "Add Python to PATH"
3. Restart your terminal

### Error: "venv\Scripts\activate not recognized"

**Solution (Windows only):**

Open PowerShell as Administrator and run:
```
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

Then try activating again.

### Still Stuck?

1. Open `01_Cheatsheets/Error_Fixing_Guide.pdf`
2. Find your error in the guide
3. Follow the step-by-step fix

## 📚 Next Steps

After completing the YouTube Downloader:

1. **Read the main tutorial** - Follow Phase 2 and beyond
2. **Try the Finance Tracker** - Build a more complex app (Phase 4)
3. **Use the Magic Prompts** - Copy-paste templates for any project
4. **Experiment!** - Try modifying the code, adding features

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Tip #1: Always Activate venv
Before running `python` or `pip` commands, make sure you see `(venv)` in your terminal.

### Tip #2: Save Often
Press `Ctrl+S` / `Cmd+S` frequently. Unsaved changes won't run!

### Tip #3: Use AI for Everything
- Don't understand a line? Ask AI to explain it
- Got an error? Paste the error to AI
- Want to add a feature? Describe it to AI

### Tip #4: Test Incrementally
Don't write 100 lines then test. Write 10 lines → Test → Write 10 more → Test.
